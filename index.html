  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Progressive Enhancement is a strategy used in web designing that starts with the bare essentials, and then adds additional features afterwards. It starts with the
    content of the site in HTML, and then once thats all done the next step is to add the CSS and design to the site, and then the final step is to add some javascript to the 
    site. This allows for a finished version of the site to be completed quickly (albeit very bare bones), and then additional features can be added in as time goes on. 
    All of these "layers" are seperate from one another, so that the core HTML doesnt depend on the css or javascript to be used. The CSS and Javascript are enhancements, 
    not requirements.
  </p>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is important because this strategy is more friendly to devices that cant handle the more complicated features. By devloping a solid HTML foundation,
    if the other enhancements (CSS and/or Javascript) dont funciton properly on a certain device, it will still have the HTML to fall back to. It also makes it easier to plan,
    develop, and even update the site. I used this strategy in this class and it made it a lot easier to complete some of the projects by having all of the HTML content already
    in place.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    After collecting feedback from various sources, the main feedback I received was two things. The first is to make white part of the image transparent, since it seems kind of
    weird to have the white background on the logo. Another suggestion I was given was to add better borders on the images in the FAQ and About sections, since they dont fit that
    well into the website, and seem kinda just plastered on. I also realized that I forgot to add the contact page, so I would need to add that as well to the revision. I think
    all of these suggestions are good, so I will attempt to implement all of them to the best of my ability.
  </p>
  <p>
    I already had experience doing html before taking this class, but I had never done CSS before, so most of my learning in this class came from the CSS portions. In that regard,
    the CSS Demo was the biggest learning experience in this class, as it taught me a lot of the basics for CSS. I didn't struggle with anything in the class, so I don't think
    I would do much different if I had to start over. I would probably try to do more complex things with my CSS, and maybe go more into javascript since I didn't use that at all
    this class.
